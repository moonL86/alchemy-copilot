The code trains a PyTorch neural network to predict viscosity, density, and pH using chemical descriptors and experimental data. It normalizes data, applies feature engineering, evaluates performance, and makes predictions for new formulations.

Trained_dataset - Table 5 from the attached Research paper is used because its experiment based.

Predictions - contains predictions, but doesn't contains cost because the cost of raw materials wasn't mentioned in research paper.

Visuals - these visuals are generated by the model itself
